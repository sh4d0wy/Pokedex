# PokeDex

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

  This is a web app made to access Pokemon data seamlessly. The user can redirect himself on 3 different routes
  - Find By Name

### Find By Name
  In this route, the user can access the Pokemon by just entering the name of the Pokemon he wants to see
    
### Find By Multiple Name
   In this route, the user can access data of multiple Pokemons by entering the name of the Pokemon he wants to see by entering names separated by commas.
    
### Find By Type
   In this route, the user can access the Pokemon by entering the type of Pokemon he wants to see
